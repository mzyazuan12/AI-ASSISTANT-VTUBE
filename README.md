Over the course of almost 2 weeks, I have finally managed to complete my personal AI Assistant Project. It is a highly complex program which is a repository consisting of 20+ different programs along with a lot of different libraries, and the only one in the world for a macOS as windows and linux usually have default solutions for translations, extracting audio files etc. 

● Leveraged OpenAI's Whisper Artificial Intelligence for speech recognition and ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo for
text processing.
● Implemented VoiceVox and DeepL to convert text to Japanese speech and stored the output in audio
files.
● Enabled real-time streaming on YouTube and Twitch with AI-driven comment responses.
● Created an avatar using VTube Studio and integrated captions via OBS.
● Overcame challenges with dependencies like Docker, Homebrew, and MeCab, and added multilingual
support using Sileno TTS models.

The 5-min AI Preview Video below has been fully uploaded on YouTube. 

Features:

- Uses an open source LLM for all its responses tweaked with any identity given in a particular file.
- Can assist in any major projects on any IDE.
- Uses my latest convolutional neural network capable of generating images using stable diffusion techniques using generation only for tasks which require it.
- Has its own avatars + 46 different Japanese voices along with my own voice trained using hundreds of audio clips.
- Able to fetch live Time, Date, Weather API, along with guiding to links on the chrome browser
